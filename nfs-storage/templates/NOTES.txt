Congratulations!  You just deployed the nfs persistent storage provider.

To use it, create a PVC which has the annotation 'volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class:' set to a value of "managed-nfs-storage"

It would be wise to configure a Storage Class, then reference that class when you create volumes in deployment objects.
